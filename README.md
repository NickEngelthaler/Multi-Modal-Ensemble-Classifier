# Staffing Agency Multi-Model Ensemble Classifier: A Mock Case Study
This repository contains the source code and associated files for a multi-model ensemble classifier developed as part of a mock case study for a staffing agency. The primary goal of the project is to enhance the staffing agency's decision-making process for employee evaluation and salary compensation using advanced machine learning techniques.

# Project Overview
In an effort to assist another firm or company as an independent contractor, this project utilizes multiple machine learning models, integrated into an ensemble classifier. The classifier predicts whether or not a candidate is worth paying above or below the industry average for a given role or position based on various input features, ultimately assisting the agency in making informed staffing decisions.

# Features and Functionality
Multi-Model Ensemble Classifier: An ensemble of diverse machine learning models is used for making predictions. This approach mitigates the risk of overfitting and generally improves the robustness of predictions.

Data Preprocessing: Comprehensive data preprocessing steps are not incorporated. All steps including handling of missing values, categorical variable encoding, and feature scaling were done using the Rattle Data Miner GUI.

Model Evaluation: A suite of evaluation metrics is implemented to assess the performance of individual models and the final ensemble classifier.

Deployment Strategy: The classifier is ready for integration into the staffing agency's existing system, facilitating a seamless transition from development to practical application.  This would require a connection between a database system in place over read_csv statements, such as MS SQL Server and an in script query to be run to pull the neccesary data.  For automatic integration you would be able to run this script through the cloud for automatic reporting.  Streamlit could be a viable application for this.
